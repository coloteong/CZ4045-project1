       " 'Julz also revealed that the watch’s magnetometer, which is basically the compass, helps detect any change in orientation as well.',\n",
       " 'This detects subtle swaying, a natural cycling movement, and helps to confirm that you’re riding a bicycle before sending an outdoor cycling workout reminder.',\n",
       " 'Then there’s self-explanatory auto pause and resume feature – a blessing for OCD cyclists who must constantly pause their workout and watch out for traffic at the same time.',\n",

       " 'Apple introduced fall detection three years ago for their watches and it quickly became an impactful feature for many users, especially the elderlies.',\n",
       " 'With the new update, the Apple Watch will now be able to recognise the unique motion and impact of falls from a bike, in a bid to keep users safe when out on the roads.',\n",
       " \"“We realized that falls can be incredibly detrimental not just in everyday activity, but also and maybe especially when you're being active while exercising.\",\n",
       " \"When you're on your bike, whether you take a turn too tightly, hit something on the road, or perhaps forgetting to unclip at a traffic stop, falls from cycling are no small thing,” said Julz.\",\n",
       " \"“So, we've updated fall detection for cycling by optimising and tuning the algorithms to recognize that unique motion and impact of falls from a bike.”\",\n",
       " 'To do this, Apple conducted extensive studies to validate the motion and impact of falls that happened during an outdoor cycling workout.',\n",
       " 'So, just like how fall detection has always worked, a hard fall alert is sound off to a user’s Apple Watch following a significant impact, and you can either dismiss it, or initiate a call to emergency services right from the notification.',\n",
       " \"If Apple Watch detects that you're not moving, and you can't communicate with emergency services, it plays an audio message when the call connects, so you can be sure to get help.\",\n",
       " 'A real lifesaver should the unthinkable happen.',\n",
       " 'The best part of it all is that you don’t even need the announced but yet-to-be-launched Apple Watch Series 7.',\n",
       " 'While watchOS 8 will require an iPhone 6S or later, and running on iOS 14, it will be compatible with all Apple watches, including the Apple Watch 6\\xa0and Apple Watch SE, although fall detection is only supported from Apple Watch Series 4\\xa0onwards.',\n",

       " '“They have asked if, you know, we would open up the Bluetooth profiles in order to do that.',\n",

       " 'Despite reservations about the name, Apple has stuck with what’s sensible and went with the number 13 for their latest iPhones.',\n",
       " 'You might have already heard, Apple’s newest iPhones are the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini, and the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max .',\n",
       " 'No surprises, there.',\n",
       " 'However, there are some profound changes compared to last year’s lineup and that could affect your purchasing decision.',\n",
       " 'Sit down, grab a cuppa, this is a long one.',\n",
       " 'Last year’s iPhones\\xa0got\\xa0a major redesign so we knew we weren’t going to be getting phones that look drastically different this year.',\n",
       " 'The basic recipe for this year’s iPhones is nearly identical to last year’s models.',\n",
       " 'In fact, unless you know what to look out for, you’d be hard-pressed to tell the difference between this year’s models and last year’s.',\n",
       " 'They all have flat sides and the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini have aluminium bodies while the iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max have stainless steel bodies.',\n",
       " 'The sides of the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini are matte, whereas the iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max have highly polished sides that are fingerprint and dirt magnets.',\n",
       " 'Round the back, the regular iPhones continue to have clear glossy glass backs while the Pro iPhones have matte glass backs.',\n",
       " 'Speaking of glass, the front of the phones are protected by Ceramic Shield, a glass that was developed with Corning to be the strongest smartphone glass ever – again, the same as last year’s models.',\n",
       " 'And since we are on the topic of protection, the IP ratings of the phones are unchanged, so all of this year’s iPhones are rated IP68 which means they can stay submerged in up to six metres of water for up to 30 minutes.',\n",
       " 'Buttons and ports are also all carried over, which means the Lightning port\\xa0is sticking around for another year.',\n",
       " 'Now, I have strong thoughts about the Lightning port.',\n",
       " 'At this point, the Lightning port should make way for USB-C.',\n",
       " 'Previously, a point could be made for compatibility but since all new Macs and nearly all new\\xa0iPads rely on USB-C, it’s time that iPhones do the same.',\n",
       " 'USB-C not only enables faster charging, it also transfers data quicker, and works with a greater variety of accessories.',\n",
       " 'It’s funny because Apple talks about all the benefits of USB-C in its Mac and iPad events and yet puts Lightning ports on their phones.',\n",
       " 'Alright, rant over.',\n",
       " 'Overall dimensions are slightly different.',\n",
       " 'Heights and widths are identical but the new iPhones all gain 0.25mm in thickness.',\n",
       " 'This is to accommodate the larger battery.',\n",
       " 'And because there’s a larger battery inside, the weight has gone up a bit.',\n",
       " 'Is it noticeable?',\n",
       " 'Sure, but only if you hold them next to each other.',\n",
       " 'Readers who have invested in expensive phone cases, however, should note that the camera bump is larger to put up the new sensors and lenses (more on this in the photography section).',\n",
       " 'So yes, if you are upgrading from last year’s phones to this year’s, these differences are enough that you will need new cases for these phones, even if you think they can stretch to accommodate the extra thickness.',\n",
       " 'Another minor difference is the notch on the display.',\n",
       " 'The TrueDepth camera system is unchanged and continues to take great 12-megapixel photos and offer Face ID authentication, but Apple has shrunk the system so the notch is 20% smaller.',\n",
       " 'Honestly, I didn’t really notice the difference until I placed it next to an older iPhone.',\n",
       " 'There are new colours to choose from.',\n",
       " 'The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini are available five colours: PRODUCT(RED), Starlight, Midnight, Blue, and Pink.',\n",
       " 'The units I have are the iPhone 13 in Pink and the iPhone 13 Mini in Midnight.',\n",
       " 'Pink is a very lovely soft shade of pink that I think can be more accurately described as pastel pink.',\n",
       " 'Midnight, on the other hand, can be easily passed off as black.',\n",
       " 'Unfortunately, I couldn’t get to see the entire lineup so I can’t comment on the other colours.',\n",
       " 'The iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max are available in four colours.',\n",
       " 'Graphite, Gold, and Silver make their return and joining them this year is the new Sierra Blue finish.',\n",
       " 'Like last year’s models, the highly polished finish is achieved using a physical vapour deposition process (PVD).',\n",
       " 'And according to Apple, the Sierra Blue model required an entirely new process that involves placing multiple layers of nanometer-scale metallic ceramics to achieve the colour.',\n",
       " 'As for the Pro iPhones, the units I have are the iPhone 13 Pro in Gold and the iPhone 13 Pro Max in Sierra Blue.',\n",
       " \"This year’s Gold finish is slightly different from last year's.\",\n",
       " \"The polished sides are indistinguishable from one another but the glass back of this year's model is a richer darker shade of gold.\",\n",
       " \"As for Sierra Blue, it appears to be a lighter shade of last year's Pacific Blue.\",\n",
       " 'Overall, fans of last year’s new design will love this year’s phones.',\n",
